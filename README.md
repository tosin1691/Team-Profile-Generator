# Team-Profile-Generator

## Description 
This is a command line application that takes in information about employees on a software engineering team, then generates an HTML webpage that displays summaries for each person. JS, Node.JS, Bootstrap and NPM libraries will be utilised to build this application.

## Programming

I used JS, Command line, node.js, Bootstrap Inquirer and Jest library to create a command line application that creates a team profile for users so that a user has quick access to emails and GitHub profiles by: 

1) prompting users for information about their team manager i.e. name, employee ID, email and office number. 
2) Upon entering the requirements above, the user is presented with the option to:
    * Add an engineer
    * Add an intern
    * Finish building the team
   
   when the user selects engineer option, then the user is prompted to enter the following and then taken back to the menu of options:
    * Engineer's Name
    * ID
    * Email
    * GitHub username
    
    when the user selects intern option, then the user is prompted to enter the following and then taken back to the menu of options:
    * Intern's Name
    * ID
    * Email
    * School

3) Exiting the application when the user decides to finish building their team

4) rendering an HTML page when the user exits the prompts in the application 

### Additional note:

* I have used CSS to style the HTML page for better UX. 

* I created classes for each team member and exported them. 

* I conducted testing for these classes and they ALL passed
